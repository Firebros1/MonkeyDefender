# MonkeyDefender
Monkey defender source code. Does not contain UI or settings folder. Get plugin here: https://www.roblox.com/library/10346314531/Monkey-Defender-BETA
In order to make the code work, make a custom UI(and settings folder), and update the local variables inside the script to reflect on your changes.
